istart: the time step to start the simulation, if it is not 0, ch_fin needs to be set to 1 to read the previous files at the starting time step.

iters: number of time steps to run, in addition to the istart.

If hot-start, set ch-fin to 1 and the output files at the time step istart will be read to initialize the simulation, or if cold start, set ch_fin to 0 for a cold start, and initial perturbations are added to the prescribed velocity profile, which is defined in initial_compact.F in code folder.

If cold start (ch_fin=0), to generate the initial perturbation, set m_fin to 0 if the mean velocity is zero, else set to 1 to read mean velocity from "means.istart", where "istart" is specified as the starting time step.

In this study, the velocity and concentration field of a clear fluid case at its latest time step is used as an initial condition for all the cases.

oi_chanL output intervals (number of time steps)
