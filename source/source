The FineSed3D model is used in this study. 
A constant pressure gradient drives the alongshore current.
Periodic boundary conditions are assigned in x-y planes.
No-slip, no-penetration wall boundary condition is assigned at the bottom boundary.
Free-slip, no-penetration rigid lid is applied at the top boundary.
Erosional-depositional boundary conditions are applied at the bottom.

Before compilation, the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) and FFTW packages are needed to be installed. For more information about these libraries, please go to:
https://software.interl.com/en-us/interl-mkl   ,   http://www.fftw.org/

To compile the numerical model, the MakeFile should be changed if necessary. There are several necessary flags in MakeFile needed to specify below:
-EXEC: the name of the executable command to be generated after compilation.
-TGZFILE: the name of the compressed file.
-INC: all the included files, which defines global variables, and mesh information.
OBJS: the rule of generating the names of object files.
MKL_HOME: define the directory of MKL library. It may vary with different operating systems.
MKLIBS: define the library links for MKL.
FLAGS: define code debug flags.
DEBUGFLAGS: define flags for code debug.
OPTFLAGS: define optimization option for compilation, use -O2 for optimization level 2.
MPFLAGS: define parallelization library, use -OpenMP for OpenMP library
-FCMP: define the include files for FFTW library
-FCSP: define the included files for FFTW library
